# Solar charge controller
There are naturally power losses that take place when the solar panel is directly connected to load/battery without matching its operating characteristics under varying solar isolation and operating temperature.
To develop an efficient, simple, durable, adaptable setup for power harvesting solar charge controller with Maximum Power Point Tracker(MPPT) is needed.


Maximum Power Point Tracker(MPPT), a power electronic device which significantly increases the Photovoltaic system efficiency.
By using MPPT, the system operates at Maximum Power Point(MPP) and produces its maximum power output.
MPPT maximizes the array efficiency, thereby reducing the overall system cost.
