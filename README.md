# Solar charge controller
Problem statement
There are naturally power losses that take place when the solar panel is directly connected to load/battery without matching its operating characteristics under varying solar isolation and operating temperature.
To develop an efficient, simple, durable, adaptable setup for power harvesting solar charge controller with Maximum Power Point Tracker(MPPT) is needed.
